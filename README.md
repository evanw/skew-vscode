# Skew support for Visual Studio Code

This adds support for the [Skew programming language](http://www.skew-lang.org) to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's [open source](https://github.com/evanw/skew-vscode) and is published as [skew-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/evanw.skew-vscode) on the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Installation

Installing extensions in Visual Studio Code is a little strange. Use Ctrl+P to bring up the in-app command line (Command+P on OS X), then type "ext install skew-vscode" and press enter when it loads.
